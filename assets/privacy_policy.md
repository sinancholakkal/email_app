# Privacy Policy for Qmail

**Last updated:** October 19, 2025

Qmail ("we," "us," or "our") built the Qmail app as a mobile email client. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information Collection and Use

Qmail requires access to certain information to function as an email client:

* **Google Account Information:** When you sign in using Google Sign-In, we collect your **email address** and potentially your **name** and **Google User ID** as provided by Google. This is used solely for authentication, identifying your account within the app, and connecting to the Gmail API.
* **Email Data:** To provide email client functionalities, Qmail accesses your Gmail data via the official Google Gmail API. This includes:
    * Reading email headers and content (to display emails).
    * Sending emails composed or replied to within the app.
    * Modifying email labels (e.g., marking as read/unread, starring, moving to trash/archive).
    * Searching your emails.

**Important:** Your email content and account information are processed directly between your device and Google's servers via the Gmail API. **Qmail does not store your email content or your Google password on any external servers.** Access tokens granted by Google are stored securely on your device using platform-specific secure storage (e.g., `flutter_secure_storage` for mobile, which is not applicable to this web page itself, but is part of the Qmail mobile app's security).

## Data Processing and Storage

* **Processing:** Email data is processed ephemerally on your device (in the Qmail mobile app) as needed to display content, perform actions you initiate (like sending or deleting), and may be cached temporarily on your device for performance or offline access. This web page itself does not process or store your email data.
* **Storage:** We do not store your email content long-term on our servers. Authentication tokens are stored securely on your mobile device (in the Qmail app) and are used solely to communicate with the Gmail API on your behalf.

## Third-Party Services

The Qmail app uses Google Sign-In and the Google Gmail API to function. These services have their own privacy policies:
* [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

This web page itself does not embed third-party services that collect your personal data beyond standard web server logs (if applicable to your hosting provider).

## Security

We prioritize the security of your data within the Qmail app. We use secure methods (like secure local storage) to store authentication tokens on your device. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. This privacy policy web page itself uses standard HTTPS for secure transmission.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy

Qmail does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
